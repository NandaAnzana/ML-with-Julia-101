<h1>What is Julia?</h1>

<p>Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for numerical analysis and computational science.<br>
<br>
Because Julia's compiler is different from the interpreters used for languages like **Python** or **R**, you may find that Julia's performance is unintuitive at first. Once you understand how Julia works, it's easy to write code that's nearly as fast as C.<br>
<br>
So, why use Julia?<br>
<ul>
<li>Julia was designed from the beginning for ***high performance***. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.</li>
<li>Julia is ***dynamically*** typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.</li>
<li>Julia has a ***rich language*** of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.</li>
<li>Julia uses ***multiple dispatch as a paradigm***, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. It provides asynchronous I/O, debugging, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more.</li>
<li>Julia has high-level syntax, making it an ***accessible language for programmers from any background*** or experience level.</li>
<li>Julia is provided under the MIT license, ***free for everyone to use***. All source code is publicly viewable on GitHub.</li>
</ul> </p>
